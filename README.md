## Inspiration
We were inspired by this idea after not being able to hear one of our group members in a noisy place and thought about how people with hearing issues would experience this type of thing every day. 

## What it does
The application shows you the direction of the voice that's talking to you and shows the spoken words as text on the screen.

## How I built it
We have a three-microphone pattern that sits on top of a hat and sends the angle of where the voice was coming from to your phone, which shows direction. We also have the ability to view the speech as text on a phone. 

## Challenges I ran into
We ran into many challenges along the way. One of the biggest challenges was getting the gyroscope enabled so that we could tell in which direction the sound was coming in.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We are proud of being able to come together and finish the project.

## What I learned
We learned how to integrate hardware and software very tightly. 

## What's next for Audite
Adding a face recognition in order to better detect when a person is talking
